**Microsoft Security Incident Analysis**

Purpose

This project is all about understanding security incidents from Microsoft’s dataset. The goal is to:

See which types of incidents happen most often.

Understand which entities (users, devices, etc.) are involved most frequently.

Find patterns in the data by simplifying complex information into a few key “factors” that explain most of what’s happening.

In short, it helps make sense of large security data and find trends that might otherwise be hidden.

What the Project Does

Cleans the Data: Removes irrelevant information and fills in missing values.

Looks at Distributions: Counts and visualizes which incident types and entity types are most common.

Simplifies Complex Data: Uses a method called PCA to reduce many features into just two main patterns for easy visualization.

Shows Patterns: Creates plots to quickly see how incidents and entities are distributed in the dataset.



Why It Matters

Security teams can use insights like these to:

Identify which incidents are most common.

Detect unusual or high-risk events.

Focus resources on the areas that matter most.

It turns a huge, complicated dataset into clear insights that are easier to understand and act on.
